## 📌 1.1 What Is the Internet?

### 🔧 1.1.1 Nuts-and-Bolts Description
- The Internet is a **network of networks** that interconnects billions of devices globally.
- **End systems (hosts)**:
  - Includes computers, smartphones, IoT devices, smart TVs, sensors, etc.
  - Located at the **edge of the Internet**.
- **Communication links**:
  - Made of **coaxial cable**, **fiber optics**, **twisted pair**, or **radio waves**.
  - Links have **transmission rates** (e.g., Mbps, Gbps).
- **Packet Switching**:
  - Data is split into packets → routed through the network.
- **Packet Switches**:
  - Include **routers** and **link-layer switches**.
  - Forward packets based on destination address.
- **ISPs**: Internet Service Providers form the backbone and access layers of the Internet.
- **Protocols**:
  - Define format, order, and actions during message exchange.
  - E.g., **TCP**, **IP**, **HTTP**, **DNS**.
- **Standards**:
  - Defined by **IETF** (RFCs), **IEEE** (Ethernet, WiFi standards).

### 💻 1.1.2 A Services Description
- The Internet is a **platform for distributed applications** (email, social media, video streaming).
- Apps communicate via **client-server** or **P2P models**.
- **Socket Interface**:
  - Interface for apps to send/receive data over the Internet.
  - Analogous to addressing and mailing a letter (IP address + port).

### 🔐 1.1.3 What Is a Protocol?
- **Protocol** = Set of rules defining:
  - Message formats
  - Order of messages
  - Actions taken on send/receive
- **Example (HTTP)**:
  1. Client sends GET request.
  2. Server responds with HTTP response.
- Real-world analogy: Saying “Hi” before starting a conversation.

## 🌐 1.2 The Network Edge

### 💻 End Systems
- Also called **hosts**; run applications (e.g., browser, mail client).
- Categorized as:
  - **Clients**: PCs, phones, requesting services.
  - **Servers**: Web servers, mail servers, providing services.
- Hosted in **data centers** (e.g., Google, AWS).

### 📶 1.2.1 Access Networks

#### 1. **Home Access**:
- **DSL** (Digital Subscriber Line):
  - Uses phone lines.
  - Asymmetric: downstream > upstream.
- **Cable**:
  - Uses cable TV infrastructure.
  - Shared bandwidth with neighbors.
- **Fiber to the Home (FTTH)**:
  - High-speed, dedicated fiber lines.
  - Expensive, future-proof.
- **Dial-up**:
  - Obsolete; uses modem over telephone lines.
- **Satellite**:
  - Good for remote areas, but high latency.

#### 2. **Enterprise Access**:
- **Ethernet**: Fast LAN access, wired.
- **WiFi (802.11)**: Wireless LANs for homes, offices.

#### 3. **Mobile Access**:
- **Cellular (3G/4G/5G)**:
  - Data access through radio towers.
  - Enables Internet on the go.

### 📡 1.2.2 Physical Media
- **Twisted Pair (UTP)**:
  - Most common (Ethernet cables).
- **Coaxial Cable**:
  - Used in cable TV and Internet.
- **Fiber Optic**:
  - High-speed, long distance, immune to interference.
- **Radio (Wireless)**:
  - Includes WiFi, cellular, satellite.

## 🔁 1.3 The Network Core

### ⚙️ 1.3.1 Packet Switching
- Data split into **packets**, forwarded **hop-by-hop**.
- **Store-and-forward**: Each router stores the full packet before forwarding.
- **Benefits**:
  - Efficient, flexible, supports many users.
- **Downside**: Congestion leads to **delay** and **packet loss**.

### ⚡ 1.3.2 Circuit Switching
- A dedicated path is established before communication.
- Resources (bandwidth) are **reserved**.
- Used in traditional telephony.
- **Downside**: Wasted resources when idle.

### 🌍 1.3.3 Network of Networks
- Internet = **hierarchical ISP structure**:
  - **Tier-1 ISPs**: National/international (e.g., AT&T, NTT).
  - **Tier-2 ISPs**: Regional.
  - **Access ISPs**: Provide home and enterprise connections.
- ISPs interconnect at **IXPs (Internet Exchange Points)**.

## ⏱ 1.4 Delay, Loss, and Throughput

### 📊 1.4.1 Types of Delay
1. **Processing Delay**:
   - Time to examine packet header.
2. **Queuing Delay**:
   - Time waiting in router buffers.
3. **Transmission Delay**:
   - d_{trans} = \frac{L}{R}
   - L = bits, R = bandwidth (bps)
4. **Propagation Delay**:
   - d_{prop} = \frac{d}{s}
   - d = length of link, s = signal speed.

### ❌ 1.4.2 Packet Loss
- Caused when buffers overflow at routers.
- Leads to dropped packets and retransmissions.

### 🚀 1.4.3 End-to-End Delay
- Total delay from source to destination.
- Approx. sum of all four delays above.

### 📈 1.4.4 Throughput
- **Instantaneous**: rate at a given instant.
- **Average**: rate over time.
- **Bottleneck link**: determines throughput.

## 🧱 1.5 Protocol Layers and Their Service Models

### 🧩 1.5.1 Layered Architecture
- **Why layers?**
  - Modular design, abstraction.
- **Internet Protocol Stack**:
  1. **Application** – HTTP, FTP, DNS
  2. **Transport** – TCP, UDP
  3. **Network** – IP, routing protocols
  4. **Link** – Ethernet, WiFi
  5. **Physical** – Bits on wire

### 📦 1.5.2 Encapsulation
- Each layer adds its **header**.
- Final data = headers + original data (payload).
- Headers removed at each receiving layer.

## 🔓 1.6 Networks Under Attack

### 🦠 Types of Attacks
- **Malware**:
  - Virus, worm, spyware, trojan.
- **DoS (Denial of Service)**:
  - Overwhelm system with requests.
- **Packet Sniffing**:
  - Intercepting network traffic.
- **IP Spoofing**:
  - Faking source IP to impersonate.

### 🔐 Defenses
- Firewalls, encryption, intrusion detection systems.
